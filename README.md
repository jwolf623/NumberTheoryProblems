Overview
This code is designed to identify and count twin primes within a specified range of numbers. Twin primes are pairs of prime numbers that have a difference of two. The code includes a function to check for prime numbers and a process to identify and print twin primes from 1 to 30.

Code Breakdown
1. Prime Checking Function

Purpose: Determines if a given number k is a prime number.

Parameters:
k (int): The number to check.

Returns:
True if k is a prime number.
False otherwise.

Logic:
It checks divisibility of k from 2 to k/2. If k is divisible by any number in this range, it is not a prime.
3. Finding Prime Numbers in a Range

Purpose: Generates a list of prime numbers between 1 and 30.

Variables:
p_nums (list): Stores prime numbers within the range.

4. Identifying Twin Primes
        
Purpose: Identifies and prints twin primes from the list of prime numbers.

Variables:
tp_count (int): Counter for the number of twin primes found.
pot_twin (int): Potential twin prime number, calculated as num + 2.

5. Printing the Number of Twin Primes

print('The number of twin primes is:', tp_count)
Purpose: Prints the total count of twin primes found in the specified range.

How to Run the Code
Ensure you have a Python interpreter installed.
Copy the entire code snippet into a Python file (e.g., twin_primes.py).
Run the file using the command: python twin_primes.py.
The output will display pairs of twin primes and the total number of twin primes found within the range of 1 to 30.

Additional Notes
The prime checking function is_prime can be optimized further to improve performance.
The range can be adjusted by modifying the loop limits in the second section of the code.
This code effectively identifies and counts twin primes in the specified range, providing a straightforward approach to exploring prime number relationships.
